<h1>Class ARGF < Object</h1>

  ARGF is a stream designed for use in scripts that process files given as
command-line arguments or passed in via STDIN.

  The arguments passed to your script are stored in the ARGV Array, one
argument per element. ARGF assumes that any arguments that aren't
filenames have been removed from ARGV. For example:

$ ruby argf.rb --verbose file1 file2

ARGV  #=> ["--verbose", "file1", "file2"]
option = ARGV.shift #=> "--verbose"
ARGV  #=> ["file1", "file2"]

  You can now use ARGF to work with a concatenation of each of these named
files. For instance, ARGF.read will return the contents of file1 followed by the
contents of file2.

  After a file in ARGV has been read ARGF removes it from the Array. Thus, after
all files have been read ARGV will be empty.

  You can manipulate ARGV yourself to control what ARGF operates on. If you
remove a file from ARGV, it is ignored by ARGF; if you add files to ARGV, they are
treated as if they were named on the command line. For example:

ARGV.replace ["file1"]
ARGF.readlines # Returns the contents of file1 as an Array
ARGV           #=> []
ARGV.replace ["file2", "file3"]
ARGF.read      # Returns the contents of file2 and file3
  
  If ARGV is empty, ARGF acts as if it contained STDIN, i.e. the data piped to your
script. For example:

$ echo "glark" | ruby -e 'p ARGF.read'
"glark\n"
<h2>Public Instance Methods</h2>
<h3>argv</h3>
argv → ARGV

  Returns the ARGV array, which contains the arguments passed to your script, one per
element.

For example:

$ ruby argf.rb -v glark.txt

ARGF.argv   #=> ["-v", "glark.txt"]
<h3>binmode</h3>
binmode → ARGF

  Puts ARGF into binary mode. Once a stream is in binary mode, it cannot be reset to non-
binary mode. This option has the following effects:

  Newline conversion is disabled.

  Encoding conversion is disabled.

  Content is treated as ASCII-8BIT.
<h3>binmode?</h3>
binmode? → true or false

  Returns true if ARGF is being read in binary mode; false otherwise. (To
enable binary mode use +ARGF.binmode+.
For example:

ARGF.binmode?  #=> false
ARGF.binmode
ARGF.binmode?  #=> true
<h3>bytes()</h3>
bytes()

  This is a deprecated alias for each_byte.
<h3>chars()</h3>
chars()

  This is a deprecated alias for each_char.
<h3>close</h3>
close → ARGF

  Closes the current file and skips to the next in the stream. Trying to
close a file that has already been closed causes an +IOError+ to be
raised.
For example:

$ ruby argf.rb foo bar

ARGF.filename  #=> "foo"
ARGF.close
ARGF.filename  #=> "bar"
ARGF.close
ARGF.close     #=> closed stream (IOError)
<h3>closed?</h3>
closed? → true or false

  Returns true if the current file has been closed; false otherwise. Use ARGF.close to
actually close the current file.
<h3>codepoints()</h3>
codepoints()

  This is a deprecated alias for each_codepoint.
<h3>each( )</h3>
each(sep=$/) {|line| block } → ARGF
each(sep=$/,limit) {|line| block } → ARGF
each(...) → an_enumerator
<h3>each_line( )</h3>
each_line(sep=$/) {|line| block } → ARGF
each_line(sep=$/,limit) {|line| block } → ARGF
each_line(...) → an_enumerator

  Returns an enumerator which iterates over each line (separated by sep, which defaults to
your platform’s newline character) of each file in ARGV. If a block is supplied, each line in
turn will be yielded to the block, otherwise an enumerator is returned. The optional limit
argument is a Fixnum specifying the maximum length of each line; longer lines will be split
according to this limit.

  This method allows you to treat the files supplied on the command line as a single file
consisting of the concatenation of each named file. After the last line of the first file has
been returned, the first line of the second file is returned. The ARGF.filename and
ARGF.lineno methods can be used to determine the filename and line number,
respectively, of the current line.

  For example, the following code prints out each line of each named file prefixed with its
line number, displaying the filename once per file:

ARGF.lines do |line|
  puts ARGF.filename if ARGF.lineno == 1
  puts "#{ARGF.lineno}: #{line}"
end
<h3>bytes</h3>
bytes {|byte| block } → ARGF
bytes → an_enumerator
<h3>each_byte</h3>
each_byte {|byte| block } → ARGF
each_byte → an_enumerator

  Iterates over each byte of each file in +ARGV+.
A byte is returned as a +Fixnum+ in the range 0..255.

  This method allows you to treat the files supplied on the command line as
a single file consisting of the concatenation of each named file. After
the last byte of the first file has been returned, the first byte of the
second file is returned. The +ARGF.filename+ method can be used to
determine the filename of the current byte.

  If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.
For example:

ARGF.bytes.to_a  #=> [35, 32, ... 95, 10]
<h3>each_char</h3>
each_char {|char| block } → ARGF
each_char → an_enumerator

  Iterates over each character of each file in ARGF.

 This method allows you to treat the files supplied on the command line as a single file
consisting of the concatenation of each named file. After the last character of the first
file has been returned, the first character of the second file is returned. The ARGF.filename
method can be used to determine the name of the file in which the current character appears.

If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.
<h3>each_codepoint</h3>
each_codepoint {|codepoint| block } → ARGF
each_codepoint → an_enumerator

  Iterates over each codepoint of each file in ARGF.

  This method allows you to treat the files supplied on the command line as a single file
consisting of the concatenation of each named file. After the last codepoint of the first file
has been returned, the first codepoint of the second file is returned. The ARGF.filename
method can be used to determine the name of the file in which the current codepoint appears.

  If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.
<h3>each_line( )</h3>
each_line(sep=$/) {|line| block } → ARGF
each_line(sep=$/,limit) {|line| block } → ARGF
each_line(...) → an_enumerator

  Returns an enumerator which iterates over each line (separated by sep, which defaults to
your platform’s newline character) of each file in ARGV. If a block is supplied, each line in
turn will be yielded to the block, otherwise an enumerator is returned. The optional limit
argument is a Fixnum specifying the maximum length of each line; longer lines will be split
according to this limit.

  This method allows you to treat the files supplied on the command line as a single file
consisting of the concatenation of each named file. After the last line of the first file has
been returned, the first line of the second file is returned. The ARGF.filename
and ARGF.lineno methods can be used to determine the filename and line number,
respectively, of the current line.

  For example, the following code prints out each line of each named file prefixed with its
line number, displaying the filename once per file:

ARGF.lines do |line|
  puts ARGF.filename if ARGF.lineno == 1
  puts "#{ARGF.lineno}: #{line}"
end
<h3>eof?</h3>
eof? → true or false
eof → true or false

  Returns true if the current file in ARGF is at end of file, i.e. it has no data to read. The
stream must be opened for reading or an IOError will be raised.

$ echo "eof" | ruby argf.rb

ARGF.eof?                 #=> false
3.times { ARGF.readchar }
ARGF.eof?                 #=> false
ARGF.readchar             #=> "\n"
ARGF.eof?                 #=> true
<h3>external_encoding</h3>
external_encoding → encoding

  Returns the external encoding for files read from ARGF as an Encoding
object. The external encoding is the encoding of the text as stored in a
file. Contrast with ARGF.internal_encoding, which is the encoding used
to represent this text within Ruby.

  To set the external encoding use ARGF.set_encoding.
For example:

ARGF.external_encoding  #=>  #<Encoding:UTF-8>
<h3>file</h3>
file → IO or File object

  Returns the current file as an IO or File object. #<IO:<STDIN>> is returned when the
current file is STDIN.

For example:

$ echo "foo" > foo
$ echo "bar" > bar

$ ruby argf.rb foo bar

ARGF.file      #=> #<File:foo>
ARGF.read(5)   #=> "foo\nb"
ARGF.file      #=> #<File:bar>
<h3>filename</h3>
filename → String

  Returns the current filename. “-” is returned when the current file is STDIN.

For example:

$ echo "foo" > foo
$ echo "bar" > bar
$ echo "glark" > glark

$ ruby argf.rb foo bar glark

ARGF.filename  #=> "foo"
ARGF.read(5)   #=> "foo\nb"
ARGF.filename  #=> "bar"
ARGF.skip
ARGF.filename  #=> "glark"
<h3>fileno</h3>
fileno → fixnum

  Returns an integer representing the numeric file descriptor for the current file. Raises an
ArgumentError if there isn’t a current file.

ARGF.fileno    #=> 3
<h3>getbyte</h3>
getbyte → Fixnum or nil

  Gets the next 8-bit byte (0..255) from ARGF. Returns nil if called at the end of the stream.

For example:

$ echo "foo" > file
$ ruby argf.rb file

ARGF.getbyte #=> 102
ARGF.getbyte #=> 111
ARGF.getbyte #=> 111
ARGF.getbyte #=> 10
ARGF.getbyte #=> nil
<h3>getc</h3>
getc → String or nil

  Reads the next character from ARGF and returns it as a String. Returns nil at the end of
the stream.

  ARGF treats the files named on the command line as a single file created by concatenating
their contents. After returning the last character of the first file, it returns the first
character of the second file, and so on.

For example:

$ echo "foo" > file
$ ruby argf.rb file

ARGF.getc  #=> "f"
ARGF.getc  #=> "o"
ARGF.getc  #=> "o"
ARGF.getc  #=> "\n"
ARGF.getc  #=> nil
ARGF.getc  #=> nil
<h3>gets( )</h3>
gets(sep=$/) → string or nil
gets(limit) → string or nil
gets(sep, limit) → string or nil

  Returns the next line from the current file in ARGF.

  By default lines are assumed to be separated by +$/+; to use a different character as a
separator, supply it as a String for the sep argument.

  The optional limit argument specifies how many characters of each line to return. By
default all characters are returned.
<h3>inplace_mode</h3>
inplace_mode → String

  Returns the file extension appended to the names of modified files under inplace-edit
mode. This value can be set using ARGF.inplace_mode= or passing the -i switch to the
Ruby binary.
<h3>inplace_mode = ext</h3>
inplace_mode = ext → ARGF

  Sets the filename extension for inplace editing mode to the given String.
Each file being edited has this value appended to its filename. The
modified file is saved under this new name.

For example:

    $ ruby argf.rb file.txt

    ARGF.inplace_mode = '.bak'
    ARGF.lines do |line|
      print line.sub("foo","bar")
    end
  Each line of file.txt has the first occurrence of “foo” replaced with “bar”, then the new line
is written out to file.txt.bak.
<h3>inspect()</h3>
inspect()

  Alias for: to_s
<h3>internal_encoding</h3>
internal_encoding → encoding

  Returns the internal encoding for strings read from ARGF as an Encoding object.

  If ARGF.set_encoding has been called with two encoding names, the second is returned.
Otherwise, if Encoding.default_external has been set, that value is returned. Failing that,
if a default external encoding was specified on the command-line, that value is used. If the
encoding is unknown, nil is returned.
<h3>lineno</h3>
lineno → integer

  Returns the current line number of ARGF as a whole. This value can be set manually with
ARGF.lineno=.

For example:

ARGF.lineno   #=> 0
ARGF.readline #=> "This is line 1\n"
ARGF.lineno   #=> 1
<h3>lineno = integer</h3>
lineno = integer → integer

  Sets the line number of ARGF as a whole to the given Integer.

  ARGF sets the line number automatically as you read data, so normally you will not need to
set it explicitly. To access the current line number use ARGF.lineno.

For example:

ARGF.lineno      #=> 0
ARGF.readline    #=> "This is line 1\n"
ARGF.lineno      #=> 1
ARGF.lineno = 0  #=> 0
ARGF.lineno      #=> 0
<h3>lines( )</h3>
lines(*args)

  This is a deprecated alias for each_line.
<h3>path</h3>
path → String

  Returns the current filename. “-” is returned when the current file is STDIN.

For example:

$ echo "foo" > foo
$ echo "bar" > bar
$ echo "glark" > glark

$ ruby argf.rb foo bar glark

ARGF.filename  #=> "foo"
ARGF.read(5)   #=> "foo\nb"
ARGF.filename  #=> "bar"
ARGF.skip
ARGF.filename  #=> "glark"
<h3>pos</h3>
pos → Integer

  Returns the current offset (in bytes) of the current file in ARGF.

ARGF.pos    #=> 0
ARGF.gets   #=> "This is line one\n"
ARGF.pos    #=> 17
<h3>pos = position</h3>
pos = position → Integer

  Seeks to the position given by position (in bytes) in ARGF.

For example:

ARGF.pos = 17
ARGF.gets   #=> "This is line two\n"
<h3>print()</h3>
print() → nil
print(obj, ...) → nil

  Writes the given object(s) to ios. The stream must be opened for writing. If the output
field separator ($,) is not nil, it will be inserted between each object. If the output record
separator ($\) is not nil, it will be appended to the output. If no arguments are given,
prints $_. Objects that aren’t strings will be converted by calling their to_s method. With
no argument, prints the contents of the variable $_. Returns nil.

$stdout.print("This is ", 100, " percent.\n")
produces:

This is 100 percent.
<h3>printf(</h3>
printf(format_string [, obj, ...]) → nil

  Formats and writes to ios, converting parameters under control of the format string. See
Kernel#sprintf for details.
<h3>putc( )</h3>
putc(obj) → obj

  If obj is Numeric, write the character whose code is the least-significant byte of obj,
otherwise write the first byte of the string representation of obj to ios. Note: This method
is not safe for use with multi-byte characters as it will truncate them.

$stdout.putc "A"
$stdout.putc 65
produces:

AA
<h3>puts( )</h3>
puts(obj, ...) → nil

  Writes the given objects to ios as with IO#print. Writes a record separator (typically a
newline) after any that do not already end with a newline sequence. If called with an array
argument, writes each element on a new line. If called without arguments, outputs a single
record separator.

$stdout.puts("this", "is", "a", "test")
produces:

this
is
a
test
<h3>read( )</h3>
read([length [, outbuf]]) → string, outbuf, or nil

  Reads _length_ bytes from ARGF. The files named on the command line
are concatenated and treated as a single file by this method, so when
called without arguments the contents of this pseudo file are returned in
their entirety.

  _length_ must be a non-negative integer or nil. If it is a positive
integer, read tries to read at most _length_ bytes. It returns nil
if an EOF was encountered before anything could be read. Fewer than
_length_ bytes may be returned if an EOF is encountered during the read.

  If _length_ is omitted or is _nil_, it reads until EOF. A String is
returned even if EOF is encountered before any data is read.

  If _length_ is zero, it returns _""_.

  If the optional _outbuf_ argument is present, it must reference a String,
which will receive the data.
The <i>outbuf</i> will contain only the received data after the method call
even if it is not empty at the beginning.
For example:

   $ echo "small" > small.txt
   $ echo "large" > large.txt
   $ ./glark.rb small.txt large.txt

   ARGF.read      #=> "small\nlarge"
   ARGF.read(200) #=> "small\nlarge"
   ARGF.read(2)   #=> "sm"
   ARGF.read(0)   #=> ""

Note that this method behaves like fread() function in C.  If you need the
behavior like read(2) system call, consider +ARGF.readpartial+.
<h3>read_nonblock( )</h3>
read_nonblock(maxlen) → string
read_nonblock(maxlen, outbuf) → outbuf

  Reads at most maxlen bytes from the ARGF stream in non-blocking mode.
<h3>readbyte</h3>
readbyte → Fixnum

  Reads the next 8-bit byte from ARGF and returns it as a Fixnum. Raises an EOFError after
the last byte of the last file has been read.

For example:

$ echo "foo" > file
$ ruby argf.rb file

ARGF.readbyte  #=> 102
ARGF.readbyte  #=> 111
ARGF.readbyte  #=> 111
ARGF.readbyte  #=> 10
ARGF.readbyte  #=> end of file reached (EOFError)
<h3>readchar</h3>
readchar → String or nil

  Reads the next character from ARGF and returns it as a String. Raises an EOFError after the
last character of the last file has been read.

For example:

$ echo "foo" > file
$ ruby argf.rb file

ARGF.readchar  #=> "f"
ARGF.readchar  #=> "o"
ARGF.readchar  #=> "o"
ARGF.readchar  #=> "\n"
ARGF.readchar  #=> end of file reached (EOFError)
<h3>readline( )</h3>
readline(sep=$/) → string
readline(limit) → string
readline(sep, limit) → string

  Returns the next line from the current file in ARGF.

  By default lines are assumed to be separated by +$/+; to use a different character as a
separator, supply it as a String for the sep argument.

  The optional limit argument specifies how many characters of each line to return. By
default all characters are returned.

An EOFError is raised at the end of the file.
<h3>readlines( )</h3>
readlines(sep=$/) → array
readlines(limit) → array
readlines(sep, limit) → array

  Reads ARGF‘s current file in its entirety, returning an Array of its lines, one line per
element. Lines are assumed to be separated by sep.

lines = ARGF.readlines
lines[0]                #=> "This is line one\n"
<h3>readpartial( )</h3>
readpartial(maxlen) → string
readpartial(maxlen, outbuf) → outbuf

  Reads at most maxlen bytes from the ARGF stream.

  If the optional outbuf argument is present, it must reference a String, which will receive
the data. The outbuf will contain only the received data after the method call even if it is
not empty at the beginning.

  It raises EOFError on end of ARGF stream. Since ARGF stream is a concatenation of
multiple files, internally EOF is occur for each file. #readpartial returns empty strings for
EOFs except the last one and raises EOFError for the last one.
<h3>rewind</h3>
rewind → 0

  Positions the current file to the beginning of input, resetting ARGF.lineno to zero.

ARGF.readline   #=> "This is line one\n"
ARGF.rewind     #=> 0
ARGF.lineno     #=> 0
ARGF.readline   #=> "This is line one\n"
<h3>seek( )</h3>
seek(amount, whence=IO::SEEK_SET) → 0

  Seeks to offset amount (an Integer) in the ARGF stream according to the value of whence.
See +IO#seek+ for further details.
<h3>set_encoding( )</h3>
set_encoding(ext_enc) → ARGF
set_encoding("ext_enc:int_enc") → ARGF
set_encoding(ext_enc, int_enc) → ARGF
set_encoding("ext_enc:int_enc", opt) → ARGF
set_encoding(ext_enc, int_enc, opt) → ARGF

  If single argument is specified, strings read from ARGF are tagged with the encoding
specified.

  If two encoding names separated by a colon are given, e.g. “ascii:utf-8”, the read string is
converted from the first encoding (external encoding) to the second encoding (internal
encoding), then tagged with the second encoding.

  If two arguments are specified, they must be encoding objects or encoding names. Again,
the first specifies the external encoding; the second specifies the internal encoding.

  If the external encoding and the internal encoding are specified, the optional Hash
argument can be used to adjust the conversion process. The structure of this hash is
explained in the +String#encode+ documentation.

For example:

ARGF.set_encoding('ascii')         # Tag the input as US-ASCII text
ARGF.set_encoding(Encoding::UTF_8) # Tag the input as UTF-8 text
ARGF.set_encoding('utf-8','ascii') # Transcode the input from US-ASCII
<h3>skip</h3>                                   # to UTF-8.
skip → ARGF

  Sets the current file to the next file in ARGV. If there aren't any more
files it has no effect.
For example:

$ ruby argf.rb foo bar
ARGF.filename  #=> "foo"
ARGF.skip
ARGF.filename  #=> "bar"
<h3>tell</h3>
tell → Integer

  Returns the current offset (in bytes) of the current file in ARGF.

ARGF.pos    #=> 0
ARGF.gets   #=> "This is line one\n"
ARGF.pos    #=> 17
<h3>to_a( )</h3>
to_a(sep=$/) → array
to_a(limit) → array
to_a(sep, limit) → array

  Reads ARGF‘s current file in its entirety, returning an Array of its lines, one line per
element. Lines are assumed to be separated by sep.

lines = ARGF.readlines
lines[0]                #=> "This is line one\n"
<h3>to_i</h3>
to_i → fixnum

  Returns an integer representing the numeric file descriptor for the current file. Raises an
ArgumentError if there isn’t a current file.

ARGF.fileno    #=> 3
<h3>to_io</h3>
to_io → IO

  Returns an IO object representing the current file. This will be a File object unless the
current file is a stream such as STDIN.

For example:

ARGF.to_io    #=> #<File:glark.txt>
ARGF.to_io    #=> #<IO:<STDIN>>
<h3>to_s</h3>
to_s → String click to toggle source

  Returns “ARGF”.

Also aliased as: inspect
<h3>to_write_io</h3>
to_write_io → io

  Returns IO instance tied to ARGF for writing if inplace mode is enabled.
<h3>write( )</h3>
write(string) → integer

  Writes string if inplace mode.
