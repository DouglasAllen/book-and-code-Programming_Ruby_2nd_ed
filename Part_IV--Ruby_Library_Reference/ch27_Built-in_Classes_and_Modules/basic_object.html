<h1>Class BasicObject</h1>

  BasicObject is the parent class of all classes in Ruby. It's an explicit blank class.

  BasicObject can be used for creating object hierarchies independent of Ruby's
object hierarchy, proxy objects like the Delegator class, or other uses where
namespace pollution from Ruby's methods and classes must be avoided.

  To avoid polluting BasicObject for other users an appropriately named
subclass of BasicObject should be created instead of directly modifying
BasicObject:

class MyObjectSystem < BasicObject
end

  BasicObject does not include Kernel (for methods like puts) and BasicObject is
outside of the namespace of the standard library so common classes will not
be found without a using a full class path.

  A variety of strategies can be used to provide useful portions of the standard
library to subclasses of BasicObject. A subclass could include Kernel to
obtain puts, exit, etc. A custom Kernel-like module could be created and
included or delegation can be used via method_missing:

class MyObjectSystem < BasicObject
  DELEGATE = [:puts, :p]

  def method_missing(name, *args, &block)
    super unless DELEGATE.include? name
    ::Kernel.send(name, *args, &block)
  end

  def respond_to_missing?(name, include_private = false)
    DELEGATE.include?(name) or super
  end
end

  Access to classes and modules from the Ruby standard library can be
obtained in a BasicObject subclass by referencing the desired constant from
the root like ::File or ::Enumerator. Like method_missing, const_missing
can be used to delegate constant lookup to Object:

class MyObjectSystem < BasicObject
  def self.const_missing(name)
    ::Object.const_get(name)
  end
end
<h2>Public Class Methods</h2>
<h3>new()</h3>
Not documented

<h2>Public Instance Methods</h2>
<h3>!obj</h3>
!obj → true or false

  Boolean negate.
<h3>obj != other</h3>
obj != other → true or false

  Returns true if two objects are not-equal, otherwise false.
<h3>obj == other</h3>
obj == other → true or false

  Equality — At the Object level, == returns true only if obj and other are the same object.
Typically, this method is overridden in descendant classes to provide class-specific meaning.

  Unlike ==, the equal? method should never be overridden by subclasses as it is used to
determine object identity (that is, a.equal?(b) if and only if a is the same object as b):

obj = "a"
other = obj.dup

obj == other      #=> true
obj.equal? other  #=> false
obj.equal? obj    #=> true

  The eql? method returns true if obj and other refer to the same hash key. This is used by
Hash to test members for equality. For objects of class Object, eql? is synonymous with ==.
Subclasses normally continue this tradition by aliasing eql? to their overridden == method,
but there are exceptions. Numeric types, for example, perform type conversion across ==,
but not across eql?, so:

1 == 1.0     #=> true
1.eql? 1.0   #=> false
<h3>object_id</h3>
__id__ → integer
object_id → integer

  Returns an integer identifier for obj.

  The same number will be returned on all calls to id for a given object, and no two active
objects will share an id.

  Object#object_id is a different concept from the :name notation, which returns the symbol
id of name.

  Replaces the deprecated Object#id.
<h3>send( )</h3>
send(symbol [, args...]) → obj
__send__(symbol [, args...]) → obj
send(string [, args...]) → obj
__send__(string [, args...]) → obj

  Invokes the method identified by symbol, passing it any arguments specified. 
you can use __send__ if the name send clashes with an existing method in obj. 
When the method is identified by a string, the string is converted to a symbol.

class Klass
  def hello(*args)
    "Hello " + args.join(' ')
  end
end
k = Klass.new
k.send :hello, "gentle", "readers"   #=> "Hello gentle readers"
<h3>equal?( )</h3>
equal?(other) → true or false

  Equality — At the Object level, == returns true only if obj and other are the same object.
Typically, this method is overridden in descendant classes to provide class-specific meaning.

  Unlike ==, the equal? method should never be overridden by subclasses as it is used to
determine object identity (that is, a.equal?(b) if and only if a is the same object as b):

obj = "a"
other = obj.dup

obj == other      #=> true
obj.equal? other  #=> false
obj.equal? obj    #=> true

  The eql? method returns true if obj and other refer to the same hash key. This is used
by Hash to test members for equality. For objects of class Object, eql? is synonymous with ==.
Subclasses normally continue this tradition by aliasing eql? to their overridden == method,
but there are exceptions. Numeric types, for example, perform type conversion across ==, 
but not across eql?, so:

1 == 1.0     #=> true
1.eql? 1.0   #=> false
<h3>instance_eval( )</h3>
instance_eval(string [, filename [, lineno]] ) → obj
instance_eval {| | block } → obj

  Evaluates a string containing Ruby source code, or the given block, within the context
of the receiver (obj). In order to set the context, the variable self is set to obj
while the code is executing, giving the code access to obj’s instance variables.
In the version of instance_eval that takes a String, the optional second and third
parameters supply a filename and starting line number that are used when reporting
compilation errors.

class KlassWithSecret
  def initialize
    @secret = 99
  end
end
k = KlassWithSecret.new
k.instance_eval { @secret }   #=> 99
<h3>instance_exec( )</h3>
instance_exec(arg...) {|var...| block } → obj

  Executes the given block within the context of the receiver (obj).
In order to set the context, the variable self is set to obj while the code is executing,
giving the code access to obj’s instance variables. Arguments are passed as block parameters.

class KlassWithSecret
  def initialize
    @secret = 99
  end
end
k = KlassWithSecret.new
k.instance_exec(5) {|x| @secret+x }   #=> 104
<h2>Private Instance Methods</h2>
<h3>method_missing( )</h3>
method_missing(symbol [, *args] ) → result

  Invoked by Ruby when obj is sent a message it cannot handle. symbol is the symbol for the
method called, and args are any arguments that were passed to it. By default,
the interpreter raises an error when this method is called. However, it is possible to
override the method to provide more dynamic behavior. If it is decided that a particular
method should not be handled, then super should be called, so that ancestors can pick up
the missing method. The example below creates a class Roman, which responds to methods
with names consisting of roman numerals, returning the corresponding integer values.

class Roman
  def roman_to_int(str)
    # ...
  end
  def method_missing(methId)
    str = methId.id2name
    roman_to_int(str)
  end
end

r = Roman.new
r.iv      #=> 4
r.xxiii   #=> 23
r.mm      #=> 2000
<h3>singleton_method_added( )</h3>
singleton_method_added(symbol)

  Invoked as a callback whenever a singleton method is added to the receiver.

module Chatty
  def Chatty.singleton_method_added(id)
    puts "Adding #{id.id2name}"
  end
  def self.one()     end
  def two()          end
  def Chatty.three() end
end
produces:

Adding singleton_method_added
Adding one
Adding three
<h3>singleton_method_removed( )</h3>
singleton_method_removed(symbol)

  Invoked as a callback whenever a singleton method is removed from the receiver.

module Chatty
  def Chatty.singleton_method_removed(id)
    puts "Removing #{id.id2name}"
  end
  def self.one()     end
  def two()          end
  def Chatty.three() end
  class << self
    remove_method :three
    remove_method :one
  end
end
produces:

Removing three
Removing one
<h3>singleton_method_undefined( )</h3>
singleton_method_undefined(symbol)

  Invoked as a callback whenever a singleton method is undefined in the receiver.

module Chatty
  def Chatty.singleton_method_undefined(id)
    puts "Undefining #{id.id2name}"
  end
  def Chatty.one()   end
  class << self
     undef_method(:one)
  end
end
produces:

Undefining one
